# Project Title: PAssword Generator

## Author: Mehrnaz Kiani




### User Story:
```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Requirements:

This project is about creating a password generator. The majority of the HTML has been done for you, all you have to do is fill in the actual generator.

* When the generate button is clicked, show the user the a series of prompts asking them for critieria. You will want to ask the following questions (it's recommended you use a `confirm` dialog unless otherwise specified):
    * What length do they want? (It's recommended you use a `prompt` for this)
    * Do they want uppercase letters? 
    * Do they want lowercase letters?
    * Do they want numeric characters?
    * Do they want special characters?
* If the user inputs invalid data (must select at least one character type, length must be between 8 and 128), then repeat the popups until they select correct data.
* Once the criteria are selected, then use a random number generator to generate the new password and return it from the function. There are a number of ways to do this, the instructional staff can help with hints on this if you need.
